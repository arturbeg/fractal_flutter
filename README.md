# Fractal

Fractal is an ML-powered network of interconnected public chats that allows branching of chats into more focused “sub-chats”, thereby overcoming the problem of
rapid conversation subject dilution and low engagement. Fractal aims to allow unacquainted individuals to spontaneously find and discuss niche topics of common interest in real-time.

This repository contains the code that powers Fractal's IOS and Android front-end interfaces. It is written using the Flutter Framework by Google https://flutter.dev/.
