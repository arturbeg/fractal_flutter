# Fractal

Fractal is an ML-powered network of interconnected public chats that allows branching of chats into more focused “sub-chats”, thereby overcoming the problem of
rapid conversation subject dilution and low engagement. Fractal aims to allow unacquainted individuals to spontaneously find and discuss niche topics of common interest in real-time.

This repository contains the code that powers Fractal's IOS and Android front-end interfaces. It is written using the Flutter Framework by Google https://flutter.dev/.


## Project Structure

This is a Flutter mobile application targeting Android and IOS. The code for the flutter app is in the folder named lib. Additionally, this repo contains a series of Firebase configuration files and cloud functions. Additionally, Fractal supports real-time search powered by Algolia (https://www.algolia.com/).
